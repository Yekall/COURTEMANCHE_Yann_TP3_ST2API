# TP3Csharp ST2 API
Yann Courtemanche

To start the programm, launch the "projet" project

Quick tutorial :

At launch you arrive on a map center on Paris.
Click anywhere on the map to select the place you want to see the weather of. It should appear in the research bar on top.
Click "Go" to switch section and print the weather information on the place, including a 4 days forecast

Questions:

1. The main issu with the TP2 was to get the values from the api. But as we had already done it in the past, it was no real issu.

2.The SOLID principles have for goals to improve OOP (Object Oriented Programming).
THe Kiss principle is to keep the code as mimimalist as possiblee, as spaghetti code is neither pleasant to read, write and debug.
The boy scout rule is a unofficial directive to always improve on code you borrow from another developper.
Finally, clean code is when readibility is not sacrifice for efficiency, nor the inverse.

3.To make my code more usefull, I would add some element : 
a button to change between different layer above the map,
 the ability to target an area (like a country or a state) for research, 
advices on what to wear this day(like a cloak if it rains),
 a table view on the data requested to keep it in memory, 
and finally a layer on top of the map that shows temperature and weather like in TV meteo forecast.
